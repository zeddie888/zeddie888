# About Me 🐙

Hi there hello!

🏢 I'm a software engineer at Meta building out WhatsApp Calling Infra

🏫 I graduated from the University of Washington as a CS major + math minor

💡 My main interests are in distributed systems, datacenter systems, compilers, deep learning, and piano performance

🔬 I do a fair bit of research in:
- datacenter systems for managing power consumption and improving energy efficiency
- deep space navigation for CubeSats, specifically star trackers
