# About Me 🐙

Hi there hello!

I'm currently an incoming new grad at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math.

My main interests are in distributed and datacenter systems, deep learning, compilers, and algorithms.

I do a fair bit of research in:
- datacenter systems for managing power consumption and improving energy efficiency
- deep space navigation for CubeSats, specifically star trackers
