# About Me 🐙

Hi there hello!

🏢 I'm a software engineer at Meta building WhatsApp Calling Infra, working to improve both infra and call quality/reliability!

🏫 I graduated from the University of Washington as a CS major + math minor

💡 My main interests are in distributed systems, datacenter systems, deep learning, compilers, and piano performance

🔬 I do a fair bit of research in:
- large-scale software systems for managing datacenter power consumption and improving energy efficiency
- fault tolerance and navigation (star tracking) for satellites

Feel free to reach out! My email is: `zeddie8888@gmail.com`
- Note: there are 4 `8`'s!
